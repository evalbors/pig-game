MORE DIFICULTY, MORE RULES

- Player looses his/her entire score when he/she rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn (Hint: always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable).
- Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100 (Hint: you can read that value with .value property in Javascript. This is a good oportunity to use google to figure this out).
- Add another dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player loosses his/her current score when one of them is a 1 (Hint: you will need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS code for the first one).
